# Prediction of night-time rental prices for apartments and houses

## Project background

In the dynamic short-term property rental sector, determining the optimal price per night is crucial to maximizing revenues while remaining competitive. This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of estimating the price per night for apartments and houses using a dataset extracted from accommodation platforms such as Airbnb. With over 400 parameters, including location, home features, amenities offered, and times of year, our model seeks to offer accurate predictions that will help hosts set their rates in an informed manner.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a reliable tool for predicting nightly rental prices based on a multitude of factors. This model will serve as a decision aid for property owners and managers on short-term rental platforms, enabling them to adjust their prices in line with market trends and the specific characteristics of their property.

We hope this tool will help optimize pricing strategies and increase guest and traveler satisfaction in the short-term rental market.
